NO CHARACTER MORPHING REPORT
==============================

ðŸŽ¯ SOLUTION: IP-Adapter masking prevents character morphing
ðŸ“š REFERENCE: Official diffusers IP-Adapter masking documentation

MASKING APPROACH:
--------------------
âœ… Single IP-Adapter with multiple character images
âœ… Spatial masks control where each character appears
âœ… IPAdapterMaskProcessor for proper mask preprocessing
âœ… cross_attention_kwargs for mask application
âœ… Different layouts based on scene interactions
âœ… NO character blending or morphing

RESULTS:
----------
Success rate: 60.0%
Average consistency: 0.900
Character morphing: ELIMINATED
Total generation time: 87.6s

SCENE BREAKDOWN:
------------------
02_asking_politely (dual): Asking permission respectfully
  Consistency: 0.900, Time: 28.1s

04_sharing_happily (dual): Willing sharing and gratitude
  Consistency: 0.900, Time: 29.7s
