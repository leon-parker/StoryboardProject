OFFICIAL APPROACH:
- Following basic Diffusers documentation exactly
- Load same IP-Adapter weight twice: ['ip-adapter_sdxl.bin', 'ip-adapter_sdxl.bin']
- Always pass both images: [alex_ref, emma_ref]
- Control with scales: [0.8, 0.0] or [0.0, 0.8] or [0.7, 0.7]
- No complex preprocessing or embedding pre-computation
